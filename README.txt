IMI Website (Remodeled) + Admin (Netlify)

Changes in this version:
- Full homepage remodel (luxury dark, mobile-first).
- Top navigation tabs: Videos / Images / Articles + Productions pages.
- Removed the old Media Library section from the middle of the homepage.
- Admin link moved to the FOOTER (Site Admin).
- Admin manages the whole site now, including a "Website" section to edit:
  hero title/subtitle, founder block, about, contact email.
- Motion upgraded: page-load banner, smoother reveals, parallax.

Founder image:
- File path: /images/founder.png
- Replace that file with your real photo (same filename) to update everywhere.

Netlify deploy:
- Best: GitHub-connected site. Replace repo contents with this folder, commit+push, Netlify auto-deploys.
- Fast: Netlify Drop - drag the folder (with index.html at top level) into Netlify.
